# Code-Quiz-Challenge-4

## Description

With the goal of having a quiz to test my knowledge of coding, I created a Code Quiz. I created a start button that when clicked, started a timer and displayed a series of questoins. When I answer was click, a new quetion was displyed. A 10 second penalty was assesed for incorrect answers. When the quiz was completed, a final score was displyed. The user coudl then input intials to have that socre recorded on the High Scores page.
